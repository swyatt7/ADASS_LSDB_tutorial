# LSDB tutorial slides for ADASS 2023

In the `nb/` folder you will find 5 tutorial notebooks that demonstrate the functionality of Large Survey DataBase [LSDB](https://github.com/astronomy-commons/lsdb/tree/sean/tutorial-demo)

The tutorial follows as:
* HiPSCat datasets and LSDB framework
* Basic HiPSCat Functionality
* Joint Analysis of HiPSCats
* Time Series Analysis of HiPSCats
* Importing your own catalogs into HiPSCat format

## To run the notebooks

1. You'll need an account on LINCC-hub. Reach out to Samuel.
2. To get started, create a Large instance on https://lsst.dirac.dev/
3. Clone this repo in LINCC-hub ("New" > "Terminal")

`$ git clone https://github.com/swyatt7/ADASS_LSDB_tutorial`

4. Work through the five sections in order to follow the logic.
5. Shutdown each notebook after you're done to use less memory.
6. For notebook #5, create a new directory like:

`mkdir ADASS_LSDB_tutorial/nb/hipscats`
